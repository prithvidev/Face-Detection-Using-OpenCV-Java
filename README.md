# Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV-Java
This Program will count the number of human faces in the Image using OpenCV library.
You can see the example in the images folder.
Remember, it is not a face recognition. it is a face detection program.
face detection program means that the program will only count the number of human faces not tell about them.

You have to set your IDE with OpenCV. First Install it from this site "https://opencv.org/releases/" and then extract it.

Thanks!
